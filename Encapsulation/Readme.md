What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that bundles data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It's like a protective capsule that shields the internal workings of an object from the outside world, allowing you to interact with it in a controlled and predictable way.

Here's a breakdown of encapsulation:

Key Concepts:

Data Hiding: Encapsulation enforces data hiding, meaning that the internal data (attributes) of an object are not directly accessible from outside the class. Access to the data is controlled through methods (also known as getters and setters).

Information Hiding: Only the essential information about an object is exposed to the outside world, while internal implementation details are hidden. This promotes modularity and reduces the impact of changes on other parts of the program.

Data Integrity: Encapsulation ensures that data is manipulated in a consistent and controlled manner through methods, reducing the risk of errors and maintaining data integrity.

Flexibility: By hiding implementation details, encapsulated objects can be easily modified without affecting the code that uses them.

Example:

Imagine a "Car" class in a program. It might have attributes like:

make: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., "Toyota")

model: The specific model (e.g., "Camry")

year: The year it was manufactured (e.g., 2023)

mileage: The number of miles driven (e.g., 10,000)

Encapsulation means that you can't directly access these attributes from outside the Car class. Instead, you would use methods:

getMake(): To retrieve the car's make.

setModel(newModel): To change the model of the car.

incrementMileage(miles): To update the mileage by a given amount.

Benefits of Encapsulation:

Modularity: Encapsulation promotes modularity by creating independent units of code that can be reused and maintained separately.

Data Security: Data hiding protects data from accidental or malicious modification, ensuring data integrity.

Code Maintainability: Changes to the internal implementation of an object don't affect other parts of the program, making code easier to maintain.

Code Reusability: Encapsulated objects can be reused in different parts of a program or even in different programs.

In a nutshell, encapsulation is like a protective barrier around an object's internal workings, ensuring that data is accessed and modified in a controlled and predictable way. It's a fundamental principle in OOP that promotes code modularity, maintainability, and data integrity.
